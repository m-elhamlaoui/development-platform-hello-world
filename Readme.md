# Satellite Tracker â€“ AI-Powered Space Surveillance System

**Satellite Tracker** is an intelligent satellite monitoring platform that leverages Artificial Intelligence, Kafka, and microservices to provide predictive and real-time insights into satellite operations. It is designed to assist in managing satellite fleets by predicting their **health status**, **end-of-life**, and **potential collision risks**, and by visualizing their operational conditions through an interactive dashboard.

## Overview

The Satellite Tracker system connects to external APIs (like [N2YO](https://www.n2yo.com)) to collect live satellite telemetry and orbital data. The data undergoes preprocessing before being sent to AI-powered microservices that analyze the information and return predictions.

These predictions are then routed to the backend services that store and serve the results to users via an interactive frontend.

---

## Key Features

### Health Monitoring
- Uses machine learning models to analyze telemetry data such as battery voltage, temperature, and data transmission rate.
- Predicts potential failures and recommends preventive maintenance.

### End of Life Estimation
- Predicts the remaining operational lifespan of satellites based on orbital characteristics and motion analysis.

### Collision Detection
- Continuously monitors distances between orbiting satellites.
- Generates alerts for possible close approaches or collision risks.

## System Architecture

![System Architecture](./Architecture/system-architecture.png)

### Main Technologies Used:
- **Backend**: Django (Python), Spring Boot (Java)
- **Data Streaming**: Apache Kafka
- **Databases**: MongoDB
- **AI Models**: Python-based ML models (scikit-learn)
- **Frontend**: Nextjs (or any frontend consuming API)

## Microservices Overview

| Microservice | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| `Data Processing Microservice` | Fetches data from N2YO, cleans and prepares it. |
| `Kafka` | Message broker for asynchronously delivering data between services. |
| `Models Microservice` | Contains and executes AI models for health, EOL, and collision prediction. |
| `Prediction Microservice` | Stores and serves predictions for visualization. |
| `User Data Microservice` | Manages user accounts and linked satellites. |
| `Frontend` | Displays visual insights and predictions to end-users. |

### ðŸ“— Sequence Diagram

Demonstrates the data flow through the microservices(healthStatusFlow):

1. Data is fetched from N2YO
2. Sent to Kafka
3. Received by the Django service for model processing
4. Predictions sent to Spring Boot services
5. Data exposed to frontend
